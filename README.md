# **Giphy Fun**

## Description:
This app lets users get trending gifs and search for specific gifs using giphy API. 

## Background info of the app:
Having so many gifs all in one page can be overwhelming, so we are getting one gif at a time. What's more? We don't know what gif we are going to get until a button is clicked!

## Technologies Used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery
* Google Fonts
* Giphy API
